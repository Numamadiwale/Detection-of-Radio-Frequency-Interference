# Detection-of-Radio-Frequency-Interference
A basic program to detect RFI using Logistic Regression model of Machine Learning
Radio Frequnecy Interference refers to unwanted radio waves emitted by the objects on earth like mobile phones , radios and cellular towers , which can interfere and taint the waves received from the outer space. In this case, an interference simply refers to the frequencies which arent the considered important to an experiment or study such as space study and observations. I have only included a very basic model called logistic Regression to better understand RFI detection and ML in general. the model was fed random generated data and was tasked to detect 150 Hz freq amongst the chaos and mark it in Red Dashes. the code can be run on google collab.
